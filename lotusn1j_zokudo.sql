What would the repealing of this policy mean for the US government and its citizens? What would be the underlying repercussions of policies proposed by President Trump? How will this impact the healthcare system?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span xss=\"removed\"><b>Obama Care :</b></span><span xss=\"removed\">&nbsp;</span><span xss=\"removed\">This is a crucial health care initiative propounded by former President Mr.Barack Obama in the year 2010.Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA),populary known as ObamaCare- uncapped health insurance coverage is made available to one and all ,thereby reducing the cost of healthcare.</span></p><p><span xss=\"removed\">This care ensures that people with pre-existing medical conditions are also able to avail of insurance ,without being rejected or over charged.Obama care has made Primary,Secondary and Tertiary Care treatment affordable and available to common man.</span></p><p><span xss=\"removed\">Studies conducted at Harvard shows that, thousands of lives are being saved every year, as patients manage to get the requisite treatment at affordable costs.</span></p><p><span xss=\"removed\"><b>President Trump’s Proposed Initiatives :</b></span><span xss=\"removed\">&nbsp;President Trump is keen on repealing the healthcare friendly and widely acclaimed Obama Care policy.</span></p><p><span xss=\"removed\">Trump administration is of the view that the Obama Care program is a death knell as majority of the insured people are the aged and sick. Republicans are keen to get rid of this scheme by cutting down the monetary source of the scheme (taxes accrued from high-income individuals).

There are millions of Americans who are dependent on the government for medical aid. The withdrawal of Obama Care would not only affect healthcare of millions ,but also result in fiscal crisis across states- if funding of Obama Care program is withdrawn.</span></p><p><span xss=\"removed\">The dilemma faced by Trump administration is two fold: whether to repeal Obama Care or alleviate tax deduction of high income individuals.Repealing of Obama Care, without providing an alternative means of security cover, will be an untenable proposition for President Trump.

Uncertainty and anxiety harbingers on their minds while selecting between the options available.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span xss=\"removed\">Patients who need skilled care after a trauma that has left them both emotionally and physically impaired or elderly patients who are suffering from some grave conditions, like cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s disease are often stuck between the choice to be in-patients at a hospital/ nursing home or be taken care of within the comforts of their home where in home care emerges out as the winner in maximum cases.&nbsp;</span><br xss=\"removed\"><span xss=\"removed\">This is just the beginning! Now comes the part where the family members have to firmly shortlist on what or who they want to take care of their loved one. The choice varies between an in-home personal aide and in-home registered nurse.&nbsp;</span><br xss=\"removed\"><span xss=\"removed\">Whereas Personal Care Aides take care of patients and stay with them as their personal companions, doing all chores for them, they do not necessarily hold expertise to cope with critical medical contingencies. With limited capabilities they act as an emotional umbrella to the patients and are usually handed out somewhere around $9 to $30 per hour.&nbsp;</span><br xss=\"removed\"><span xss=\"removed\">Registered Nurses are invariably sought for patients who need skilled nursing services. Indispensable in their dispensation by monitoring vital parameters, medications, caring of the wounds, therapy, RN Nurses charge somewhere from $25 to $50 per hour. Their cost varies depending on several factors such as their number of visits, the length of their visit, and their service.&nbsp;</span><br xss=\"removed\"><span xss=\"removed\">Services of the therapists are pursued when patients have lost mobility or sensation in a body part due to a traumatic injury and cannot cope with their impairment. Physical Therapists or Occupational Therapists gradually help restore motion back in the patient’s body by exercising regime and teach them how to cope with their surroundings in spite of their disability.&nbsp;</span><br xss=\"removed\"><span xss=\"removed\">The therapists /Registered Nurses may enter into an agreement with the patients where they extend their services on per visit basis. This provides them an opportunity to work according to their preferences and terms. The underlined concept here is ‘more the visits more the remuneration.</span><br xss=\"removed\"><span xss=\"removed\">We can easily refer to it as a part time job which is beneficial for both the patients and the skilled aides. Patients are reviewed intently, they receive personal care on each visit and their minute problems are attended to, at every visit.&nbsp;</span><br xss=\"removed\"><span xss=\"removed\">Depending upon the travelling expenses spent on visits, number of hours that are put in to review the patients, proficiency required for the dispensation of the service, time of the day when the patients are visited and whether it is a routine or an emergency visit are often the deciding factors of the cost that is charged by them.&nbsp;</span><br xss=\"removed\"><span xss=\"removed\">At United Healthcare Staffing, an experienced and creditworthy agency we are striven towards unabridged customer contentment and maximum remunerative jobs for our medical recruits.

For the remaining 30% the premium expected to be paid after a hike of 10% should fall somewhere around $134/monthly in 2017 as compared to $121.80 in 2016.

Education\r\nin medicine also demands its students to bear the cost of attaining technical\r\ngadgets like stethoscopes, blood pressure apparatus, thermometers and much\r\nmore.

The profession also comes with its share of challenges for individuals who want to get involved in the business. Much like all other jobs in the world, this profession also has several pitfalls. However, one must know the right way to tackle those to reach the very top of success in their career in the healthcare industry. Let’s talk about a few challenges that are frequent in the work of travel nursing and why it is not considered viable for absolutely everybody or anybody.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1) Family issues: The most exciting aspect of travel nursing can very well be the worse aspect of travel nursing. The professionals are expected to work on different shores and lands, staying miles away from their family and friends. Many individuals find it\r\nincredibly hard to tackle loneliness during the initial days of the contract. The right solution to this issue is to establish new contacts or make new friends. Although the process does not bear fruit immediately, it turns out to be a handy alternative eventually.</p>\r\n<p>2. Sudden home-calls: Travel nurses are always on the road to reach every corner of the country that needs medical attention. While they are under contract and working in some\r\nmedical institution, situations may arise when they might have to return home on a temporary or a permanent basis. A crisis like somebody’s death, personal health issues and a few more, genuinely demand the individual’s presence back in his or her family.\r\nDuring this time, the nurse must decide to inform both the staffing agency and the medical institution. Altering the staffing agency first will give them a shot at filling the soon-to-be vacant position with another nurse or strike up a negotiation with the\r\nhospital for the nurse’s best interest.</p>\r\n<p>3. Abnormal work routines: Travel nurses are mostly required by medical institutions and hospitals that are running short on staffs. The professionals are used to fill the void, and may necessarily have short stints with the respective medial institutions. As hospitals are forever working to aid patients, nurses are mostly prepared to work through different work routines. Although things often turn tough for travel nurses who may have to work during abnormal work hours like night duty or long extensive hours. The key to finding happiness in the experience is to realise the nobility of the job and the fact that they are serving the community.</p>\r\n<p>4. Quick learning: Quick learning is one of the most decorated skillsets a nurse can have in the healthcare industry. Most travel nurses have this in their repertoire as they are always changing workstations and colleagues. They need to adapt immediately to new work environments and personnel to perform their duties. Being able to learn things quickly benefits them by incorporating new techniques and ideas from unknown places.</p><p><br></p><p>More Information please visit our website :- <a href=\"http://www.uhcstaffing.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.uhcstaffing.com</a></p>', 'Travel Nursing Jobs', 'TRAVEL NURSING IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY', 'UHC Staffing provides important details why travel nursing jobs are not for everybody.

However, the fact does not inherently mean that getting employed in the industry is very easy. Registered nurses that are fresh graduates are finding it extremely tough to negotiate with the market. More and more employers are dismissing new graduates right, left and centre as they are only interested in hiring experienced nurses. The National Student Nurse’s Associations have stated that about 36% of newly licensed Registered Nurses graduating in 2011 were unemployed till four months post their graduation. In Central California, the problem looks even worse with 43% RNs not having any job within the first eighteen months of their graduation. Such facts were extracted from a 2011 survey that was conducted by the California Institute of Nursing &amp;amp; Healthcare (CINHC).</p><p>The situation is not at all inspiring with all the employers only seeking experienced professional for their vacancies, yet they are adamant about hiring fresh recruits. About 90% of nurses are women of which 60% are married and a quarter is above the exclusive age bracket of 50. It is sufficiently rational for nurses to take a break in their thirties to raise their kids. Due to the long shifts on toes, most nurses retire in their late fifties. A significant statistic says that before the recession in the United States; about 73,000 nurses left the workforce each year due to multiple reasons like childbearing, retirement, burning out or death. </p><p>Simultaneously, nursing colleges recorded increasing growth in enrolment. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing has shared that more than 170,000 people enrolled through entry-level baccalaureate nursing programs in 2010-11. The number is staggeringly double the students from a decade earlier.</p><p>The high demand for healthcare services will only rise in the charts as more and more baby</p><p>boomers progress to their retiring stage in life. The application will be encouraged as healthcare reforms continue to make medical attention accessible to everyone. Healthcare administrators need to structure long-range plans and improvements for offering expert nurses at the bedside in the oncoming future.

Exercising outdoors is not only beautiful but also has other major perks. If you do not stay at a place that is naturally hot, you\r\ncan use this opportunity to travel somewhere new and exciting, all the while exploring new places and destinations.<br></p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf you have already decided that you will exercise outside in the heat, like cycling on a warm sunny day, there are certain things that you need to keep in mind. Safety should be your first and major concern and therefore in today’s article we will discuss some important safety tips to follow while exercising in the heat. <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n1. Exercise Early\r\nAs children we were always taught that waking up early and making it a way of life will lead us\r\nto great benefits in the future. The same principle applies to exercising as well. Therefore you\r\nshould strictly avoid exercising when the majority of the sun is out. For example, don’t exercise\r\nin between 10 am to 3 pm, as this is usually the hottest time of the day. Exercising early will not\r\nkeep your body cool, you will feel more relaxed and calm after the exercise because of the cool\r\nweather outside.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n2. Light Colours\r\nWe have all seen the commercials of popular sports brands like Nike and Adidas. When they are\r\npromoting their outdoor exercise sportswear, look closely and you will find several light\r\ncolours. Wearing light colours when exercising outdoors will ensure that your clothes will\r\nreflect the heat from the sun thus cooling down your body faster.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Another aspect to remember is to wear loose fitting clothes. This will allow a much greater\r\ndegree of air circulation in your body thus ensuring that your sweat dries up fast and you are\r\ncool by the end of your exercise session.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n3. Sunscreen\r\nWhen we think about exercising, we are all pumped up and easily forget about our health. In\r\nthis case we forget that exercising outside without proper protection of our skin might have\r\ndevastating effects. Thus before going for your run or cycling, make it a point to apply\r\nconsiderable sunscreen on your exposed skin.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWell Hydrated\r\nThis is one of the most common tips in the entire list, and still a lot of us tend to ignore this fact.\r\nWhile exercising your body will sweat a lot. This means that you will quickly loose energy if you\r\ndon’t end up hydrating your body at regular intervals during your workout.<br>\r\nMake sure to carry a bottle of cool water at all times during your outdoor exercise. Whenever\r\nyou feel drained out and tired, take a sip of it and your energy will quickly replenish.\r\nConclusion<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLike most other things in life, outdoor exercise too comes with a lot of advantages and\r\ndisadvantages. While the disadvantages are clearly lower, follow the above list of safety tips in\r\norder to avoid them completely.\r\n</p>', 'healthcare california,Health care Agency in california ', 'SAFETY TIPS FOR EXERCISING IN THE HEAT IN UHC STAFFING', 'FIND SAFETY TIPS FOR EXERCISING IN THE HEAT AT UHC STAFFING.', 'SAFETY TIPS FOR EXERCISING IN THE HEAT, Health care Agency in california, Health Care stafing servises', 1),

Especially with food, there a lot of challenges and often times you get confused as to what you should feed your child. On top of that, being pre diabetic means that the doctor or physician supervising your child’s health has fixed a chart which outlines the amount of food,the timings for the same and suggested quantity. From time to time, it becomes difficult for both the parent and the child to keep up with this chart and they are more than willing to take cheat days. But in those days too, there are only specific healthy foods that your child can have.</p><p>As a parent, you might confused as to what your child needs to eat and what is actually healthy for him or her. Therefore to help you out, we have coagulated a list of 9 ways, following which you can make sure your child is always eating healthy.</p><ol><li>We all know that vegetables and fruits are very healthy for humans no matter at what age they are. Therefore continuing this tradition give your child one fruit or one vegetable during every snack and meal.</li><li>If your child is a fan of your spaghetti sauce, introduce chopped vegetables in it as well.A good choice for vegetables can be frozen chopped spinach, or broccoli. After you have simmered the mixture for a while, put the entire thing in a food processor and no will ever come of the actual ingredients you used to make this yummy sauce.</li><li>You can follow the same style of adding vegetables when you are cooking your kid’s favorite macaroni as well. Additionally start introducing your child to whole-wheat pasta. The sooner they are exposed to it, the more easily they will accept it.</li><li>When preparing sandwiches and other delicacies which involves the use of butter or cheese, try avoiding them. Instead go for a seasoning of healthy olive oil.</li><li>Most kids these days love French fries. But instead of the store ones that are just ready to cook and are extremely unhealthy settle them for oven baked ones. While making them use a little bit of olive oil and bake for 50 minutes or until they are tender. During serving, sprinkle a little bit of salt on top and serve with ketchup.</li><li>One of the best ways to make your kids at healthy is to include them in the cooking process. Historically it has been proved that kids love eating what they have cooked. Therefore the chances of them enjoying their self-cooked healthy meals are higher.</li><li>Last but not the least, is setting up an example for your children. Always remember that kids develop habits and grow up to become what they see on a daily basis. Likewise if you want them to eat healthy and stay fit, make sure you follow the same routine and pattern.</li></ol><p>All the best!</p><p>United Health care staffing is a medical staffing and managed services provider in healthcare.

Depending on the score of their BMI,&nbsp;doctors can easily determine if the person is underweight, perfect, obese or over weight at any&nbsp;point in time. The current guideline that is followed across the world states that the average&nbsp;BMI of a male should be in the range of 18.5 to 24.9, which translates to a weight between 53.5&nbsp;to 72 kilo grams for males. The same calculation holds true for females as well.</div><div style=\"\"><br></div><div style=\"\"><b>Body fat percentage</b></div><div style=\"\"><div style=\"\">If you are a person who is slightly more concerned about their weight than your peers, you&nbsp;<div style=\"display: inline !important;\">should be aware of your body fat percentage as well. In layman terms, your body fat&nbsp;</div><div style=\"display: inline !important;\">percentage translates to how much of your weight is made up of fat and how much of muscles.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"display: inline !important;\">Most clinics now a days have weight machines which can easily count your body fat percentage.</div></div><div>The logic behind the importance of body fat percentage is that, excess fat which makes you overweight is highly unsuitable for your body. Not only does it make you lazy, excess fat in your body increases the risk of fatal diseases at a later point in life.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Hip Ratio</b></div><div><div style=\"\">Last but not the least, is your knowledge about waist hip ratio. In order to measure this, you need to calculate both your hip and waist size and then compare them with the ideal measurements in a chart. The score you get will help doctors and medical practioners understand where your excess fat is being stored.</div><div style=\"\"><div>A high score usually indicates that you have a lot of fat in the abdominal region which will severely increase your chances of a fatal disease later on.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Conclusion</b></div><div><div style=\"\">Now that you know what all measurements are needed before you move forward with weight loss, make sure to follow these rules to get the perfect measurement every time.</div><ol><li>Always use a non-stretchable measuring tape for taking all your measurements. This willgive you accurate results and is easy to operate as well.</li><li>During measurement always make sure that the measuring tape is leveled with your body and it is always parallel to the floor.</li><li>Last but not the least, try to keep the tape as close to your skin as possible,&nbsp; ithout depressing it.</li></ol><p>More information please visit our website :-&nbsp; www.uhcstaffing.com</p><p><br></p><br></div></div><br></div></div><br></div></div>', 'MEASURE WEIGHT LOSS', 'MEASURE WEIGHT LOSS - ART OF HEALING', 'Find detailed information about MEASURE WEIGHT LOSS Causes.', 'MEASURE WEIGHT LOSS, ART OF HEALING', 1),

According to the Canadian immigration laws, full-&nbsp;time work is calculated to be 37.5 hours per week of practice. They usually accept very short&nbsp;breaks in the continuity of employment. Applicants might be employed as the application&nbsp;process often tends to be lengthy and complicated. However, as long as the applicant presents&nbsp;valid documents, his or her experience between the point of applying and acceptance will be&nbsp;counted by the visa officer. Applicants should provide updated work documents at regular&nbsp;periods before submission for consideration during the assessment period.</p><p><b>Occupational caps</b></p><p>There are caps to any and every occupation in the country every year. Immigration, Refugee&nbsp;and Citizenship Canada (CIC) admit only admits a fixed number of individuals for&nbsp;professions on any given year. Presently, a total of about 5000 skilled workers’ applicants are&nbsp;processed every year and 300 per occupation. However, the caps do not consider applicants&nbsp;with arranged employment or PhD programs. As the caps in the healthcare industry are&nbsp;always in high demand, it is necessary to apply as soon as possible.</p><p><b>Validation of work documents</b></p><p>Applicants will need to prove the validity of their past work experience during application.&nbsp;Income tax returns and receipts are not enough to suffice the matter. The best option is to&nbsp;offer the letter of reference from the past or present employers. The document must have the&nbsp;signature of the official and that too, on the company letterhead. The message must feature&nbsp;the period of employment, salary, position, duties with the card of the individual himself.</p><p>If the applicants cannot provide these details, then they must include a detail explanation of&nbsp;the situation. Their next alternative will be to provide old contract documents with employers&nbsp;and performance appraisals. In case, this is also not possible, then the applicant’s situation&nbsp;might be in jeopardy. He or she will need to provide some documentation to the CIC that will&nbsp;prove his or her work experience in the past.</p><p><b>Language and the IELTS or TEF Exam</b></p><p>Each applicant- including those born and raised in English speaking countries must offer&nbsp;results of an IELTS exam along with the application. The only acceptable English language&nbsp;tests are the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). The review is&nbsp;conducted across the globe. Applicants will be unable to proceed further without submitting&nbsp;the results of this exam.</p><p><b>Adaptability</b></p><p>Applicants are judged on the merit of their adaptability prospect by the CIC. They are given&nbsp;an extra edge if they have previous experience in education or work in Canada. Having&nbsp;relatives and friends or arranged employment also counts in the case.</p><p>More Information please visit our website : <a href=\"#\" style=\"color:red;\">www.uhcstaffing.com</a></p><p><br></p><p><b></b><br></p><p><b></b><br></p><p><b></b><br></p><p><b><br></b><br></p>', 'Occupational caps', 'CANADIAN IMMIGRATION LAWS FOR HEALTHCARE JOBS', 'UHC Staffing offers complete details about CANADIAN IMMIGRATION LAWS FOR HEALTHCARE JOBS.', 'CANADIAN IMMIGRATION LAWS, CANADIAN HEALTHCARE JOBS', 1),

The industry has an extraordinary power to transform lives. It helps millions and millions of people return to life daily. However, there is one big question that is standing in front of its growth today. What can transform healthcare in these modern times?</div><div><br></div><div><div>The leading or viable solution points towards big corporations and companies which act as employers in the global spectrum of the healthcare industry. They face a regular challenge of offering their workers with low-cost but high-quality care. The picture was somewhat similar back in the days of World War II when industrialist and shipbuilder Henry Kaiser transformed the healthcare for his employees. His idea was eventually turned into the Kaiser Permanente health plan. Drawing inspiration from this, big entities like Amazon and JP Morgan Chase are making their strides to introduce independent companies that will have free from profit-making incentives and constraints.</div><div><br></div><div><div>Expert minds are identifying three areas in healthcare that these companies are more likely to focus on.</div><div><ol><li>Amazon’s image has changed drastically since its inception, as the business has evolved into a creative collection and source of data to benefit consumers purchasing across the diverse range of products and services. The company has the knack of finding innovative ways to break the conventions of infrastructural complications. Companies like Amazon and Apple are trying to abolish the lack of standardisation to share data that had made it tough to unleash the raw and untapped potential of that data to feed analytics.</li><li>The insufficient presence of competition and pricing transparency between healthcare providers affects the insane high costing of healthcare. The companies are planning to implement techniques that determine their online marketplace to establish a national cost network of hospitals, pharmacies and physicians. The transparent cost network would enable the patients to get full coverage for the highest-value providers. However, they would have to pay more than usual.</li><li>The only area in healthcare that has been both tremendously criticised and scrutinised is pharmacy expenses. Companies like JP Morgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway (Warrant Buffet) are adept at creating value-based contracting solutions to offer pharmaceutical manufacturers with the better predictable flow of profit. The data management and analytic capabilities of Amazon could monitor the improvement of medication adherence, evaluate the customised medicine prospects, and supervise medical outcomes. The information generated from this may contribute to bringing some change in the cost curve.</li></ol><p>More Information please visit our site <a href=\"#\"> www.uhcstaffing.com</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div></div></div>', 'healthcare california', 'United healthcare Staffing Agency California', 'what are companies like amazon, berkshire hathaway and jp morgan chase doing to change healthcare', 'Healthcare Jobs in California', 1);
