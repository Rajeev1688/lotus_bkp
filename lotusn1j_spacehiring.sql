But with the advent of the technologically advanced era, new businesses started sprouting out like volcanoes and a number of eminent professionals in India as well as in other countries started entrepreneurial ventures. However, unlike the established businessmen they did not have a strong capital support that can help them set up their own office spaces paying high rates. The only investment they had was Knowledge. The concepts like <strong>freelancing</strong> and <strong>work from home</strong> started becoming popular. But the greatest challenge that they faced was keeping the distractions away and having a well-organized office space at home, which was near to impossible with families and friends around anytime and every time.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The only investment new and ambitious businesses had was Knowledge.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how do we help these aspiring professionals have a peaceful work experience?

If your answer is yes, then the solution to all your queries is a coworking space. As the name suggests, you can take up a workspace shared with aspiring and eminent professionals like you for a day or a week or a month or for any duration of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are five things that a <strong>co-working space</strong> can help a start-up with to gear-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Attractive &quot;office space on rent&quot;!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Attractive coworking office\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-m4dgeD9PW6k/U15xJiLcHPI/AAAAAAAAFOo/RD7t9q9j5Uc/s640/75%5B5%5D.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:263px; margin-left:20px; margin-right:20px; width:350px\" />As a start-up, you need to ensure that your clients are dragged to your workspace so that they get comfortable to work with you. An attractive, well-decorated and well-furnished workspace is the first face of your company to your clients. Coworking spaces have awesome decor, infrastructure and facilities, which creates a conducive environment for working, especially for the millennials. Our friends at Gpayroll talk about reasons behind the boost in productivity due to an informal work environment in <a href=\"http://www.gpayroll.com/blog/human-resource/benefits-of-an-informal-working-environment.html\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Flexible work experience</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Flexible Coworking space \" src=\"http://www.thecareermuse.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Ideal-Work-Culture-Infographics_CareerBuilder-India-1.jpg\" style=\"height:283px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ellen Ernst Kossek and Kelly Hannum of Forbes discuss <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ccl/2011/06/29/flexibility-can-boost-employee-productivity/#7dfa937f5d04\" target=\"_blank\">how flexibility can boost employee productivity</a>.

It is not meant just for individuals and freelancers. Let&rsquo;s say you are a team of twenty wanting a private workspace of your own. <strong>Coworking spaces </strong>are available to cater to such needs as well. So you can work anytime of the day with all your team members with all the necessary facilities and privacy in place. It allows you to experience the flexibility of your home with a professional touch.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Community</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Coworking space community formation\" src=\"https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/16x9/822/20160201174321-working-community-work-bench-group-young.jpeg\" style=\"float:right; height:281px; width:500px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another attractive and unique feature about these shared workspaces is the community you develop with similar startups and freelancers. It gives you an opportunity to learn from their experiences and share yours as well. It provides a platform to connect, explore and work together with other professionals who can be of assistance to your work. It gives you the space to collaborate and work together with professionals from various fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A space for collaboration!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"Coworking space collaborative culture\" src=\"http://crossculturework.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image-2.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:500px; width:500px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you in&nbsp;&nbsp; need of a designer for your new website?

To develop a well-equipped workspace calls for huge investment, which at the time of starting-up is considered risky; One may not know if the business would lead to where we want it to go. Resorting to coworking spaces is a wise choice as you can pay for only the number of days you use the workspace and at the same time get access to all types of facilities from printing, photocopying, Wi-Fi, networking, fully-furnished workstations, cafeteria, lounge and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do not feel that you are alone with your start-up. Coworking spaces are here to help you fight the challenges you would face while making your startup a successful business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'Startups have been some of the quickest adopters of coworking spaces globally.

No wonder, deciding the principle base of your business operations is the complex task as it is a key to unlock the success. &nbsp;The decision regarding the selection of your workspace is based on many criteria, among which scalability of your business and availability of resources and funds plays an important role. Let`s find out the things you need to understand before making an important decision regarding your workspace,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Business or Profession</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Business or Profession Space Hiring\" src=\"http://www.strategy-business.com/media/image/StrategyH_thumb5_690x400.jpg\" style=\"float:left; width:50%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe career option you have chosen is very critical in deciding the workplace. If you are paving your way towards a business then it&rsquo;s always recommended that you should have your own office because a business model requires employing people under you and a continuous pattern of meeting prospective clients. Under a business model, having your own office comes handy when you are trying to lure the clients and investors towards your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your choice is a Profession then you can choose a Co-working space because you are required to perform your specialized skills and you certainly don&rsquo;t require employee for that. Majority likes to work as Freelancer and maximum help they require is a manager (in case you become a big thing in market), so the obvious choice become a co-working space because work from home is a lonesome activity whereas in a co-working space you will have a gorgeous office and high chance of building a network and finding much-needed synergy for your growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Scalability of Business</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Scalability of Business Space Hiring\" src=\"http://www.connectship.com/scalable/scalable3.jpg\" style=\"float:left; width:50%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The range of your business operations or service offered is another vital aspect for deciding the base. &nbsp;If the business or profession has been initiated with high or medium scalability then it&rsquo;s always preferred to have your own business because the number of dealing in a day will be very high and the strength required to operate the operations will be numerous and it will be difficult to handle the business or profession in a co-working space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, if you decide to launch your business or profession locally or within a restricted area then the obvious choice shall be a co-working space because there is no prudence in having your own office and employ additional employees and bear the hidden cost. A low scalable business or profession is at its best if operated from a co-working space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>3)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Long Term Investment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Long Term Investment Space Hiring\" src=\"http://projectm-online.com/app/uploads/long-term-investment-sketch.jpg\" style=\"float:left; width:50%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe sole aim of your business and profession is to expand as much as you can in short period of time and you are backed by a strong financial force and that too for a long term then make your &nbsp;way towards building your own office. Your own office will give you benefits like a huge space for maintaining the employee strength, secrecy towards your key operations and carrying out operations in a smooth manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your goal is sustainability and establishing yourself in market, but you don&rsquo;t have the much-needed capital to run your it at a separate place and it doesn&rsquo;t require expansion in near future then your obvious choice should be a Co-working space where you can deal in your business or profession without incurring expense of your separate office and make it a burden on your growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>4)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hidden Costs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Hidden Costs Space Hiring\" src=\"https://getlocalization.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/iceberg.jpg\" style=\"float:left; width:50%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOne of the most underrated aspects is hidden costs. Hidden costs are mostly neglected while making the choice in every decision regarding the business or profession. Be it a business or profession, after you have decided your line of work, scalability and the funds you will be backed by, still there is one aspect left without which your decision will be incomplete and that is Hidden costs.<br />\r\nA prudent person will always calculate the precise cost that will be incurred while operating his/her business or profession. Be it a co-working space or separate commercial space, the owner or entrepreneur shall always calculate the every cent that will be spent directly or indirectly on the business or profession and then both the option shall be compared to reach the final decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBefore you reach to a final decision always remember that these 4 things go hand in hand. You cannot decide on the basis of the only aspect and ignore others. For a prudent decision, you shall heed to every aspect equally and do the math before reaching a verdict.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>', 'The decision regarding the selection of your workspace is based on many criteria, among which scalability of your business and availability of resources and funds plays an important role.', '6_blog.jpg', 1, '2016-10-27 08:17:54', 'Malhi Surendra'),

The overall increase in the country is by 12% in the rental market. The sudden increase is said to be a positive impact of the demonetization, because people are making quick and frequent inquiries about properties for rent instead of buying them. The Real estate agents believe that the rental sector will see a boom soon and it will give rise to the residential rental property market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier it was believed that the prices of the properties will fall by 20%-30% because of the demonetization, but the real estate sector has already seen a downfall to its lowest in the last one or two years, so there was no point of believing that the prices will go down because of the demonetization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.google.co.in/search?q=for+rent&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1172&amp;bih=371&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmlPLy0frQAhXIOI8KHWNPDCcQ_AUIBigB#tbs=simg%3Am00&amp;tbnid=Ljb0QwpO7JA9qM%3A&amp;docid=P6CZ2d115h6cEM&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgrc=tX8kqDUy_bxYWM%3A\" style=\"float:left; width:50%\" />The demonetization will bring the transparency in the real estate market and there will be a revolutionary change in the methods of buying properties. The Primary real estate market involves very less black money and it is not at all used for buying properties in the metro cities, Tier-Two and Tier-Three cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major economists of the country believe that the demonetization will positively impact the real estate sector in the next 6-12 months. During this period the consumers will buy very less&nbsp;homes, and ultimately making it a very good reason for the increase in the demand of&nbsp;residential rental property. The potential buyer, as for now, wants to look at the movement of the real estate sector and willing to stay in the residential rental property.

Take care of your belongings. And well, respect all the stuff already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. If you take a book from the shelf do put it back in the same place at the end of the day. Also, don&#39;t take any of these books home without letting either Karan or Mika know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Communicate. Are you going to have a small meeting with a few persons in the office? Let Mika know so we can make sure that the meeting area is available for you to use, so that everyone is comfortable, and you can have your meeting in peace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Call your friends over! Of course you want them to see the awesome new place you work from. We love visitors! Just try not to be too disruptive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Ever hear of &quot;Feierabendbier&quot;? Now you have. We love this little tradition of having a chilled beer after work (or during). There&#39;s always beer available in our refrigerator for you to consume at MRP. However, this does not make our work space a party/pub. Be mindful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Smoking is death. But if you must, as a lot of us do, please smoke outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. n&#39;t set the place on fire.</p>\r\n', 58),
